# MyPortfolio
A repository of things I've worked on/am working on independently
outside of class or professional positions.

It's a somewhat small space, as I was first introduced to programming in college, and have been keeping fairly busy with official work of one variety or another since then, but on the rare occasion I've found myself with sufficient free time, energy, and inspiration to do independent learning/work, this is what's come of it (that I've remembered to upload, which seems to be half the battle sometimes!)
