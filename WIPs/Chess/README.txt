Goal:

	A simple chess playing algorithm utilizing chess.js for functionality and
	chessboard.js for GUI. Minimax algorithm will be used to determine best move
	in terms of material and positional advantages available multiple moves ahead
	(hard-coded positional and material values assigned). Alpha-beta pruning
	will make algorithm runtime complexity viable. 

Currently: 

	**BROKEN** Unpruned minimax algorithm.
	Successful minimax algorithm has been achieved, and 
	was lost prior to repository set up. Functions for playing immediate next
	best move are present, but not utilized.
